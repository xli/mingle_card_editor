    When you visit any Card show page, the card description will be replaced by an inline editor after page loaded. To disable inline editing, please disable this extension or add a "?" and something else after card number in url.
    Limit: can't work with a Mingle instance start with a contextPath yet (e.g. our QA machine started with /mingle)
