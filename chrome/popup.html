    When you visit any Card show page, the card description will be replaced by an section editor after page loaded. To disable editing after loaded page, please disable this extension or add a "?" and something else after card number in url.
    Limit: can't work with a Mingle instance start with a contextPath yet (e.g. our QA machine started with /mingle)
